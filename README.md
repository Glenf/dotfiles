# Dotfiles

These are my `dotfiles`. There are many `dotfiles` available, but these are mine. I've got `dotfiles` for zsh, vim/neovim, and tmux.

## Installation

If you trust me you could run `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glenf/dotfiles/main/install)"`. I wouldn't trust me.

## Credits

Some of this stuff is inspired by https://github.com/joshtronic/dotfiles. So thank you.
